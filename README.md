# AI NFT Generator

## Technology Stack & Tools

- Solidity (Writing Smart Contracts & Tests)
- Javascript (React & Testing)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) (Development Framework)
- [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) (Blockchain Interaction)
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) (Frontend Framework)
- [NFT.Storage](https://nft.storage/) (Connection to IPFS)
- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) (AI Models)

### - The user just has to write in words and the AI Model will automatically generate the image based on the description.

### - After the image is created the program will make some API calls and store the image in the IPFS and then it will be tagged with a smart contract to convert it into NFT.

### - These NFTs can represent anything from artwork to music, and even digital real estate. But here I only focused on the "random image generation". The use of AI in NFT minting can help to speed up the process of creating unique NFTs, as well as provide a level of randomness and unpredictability to the generated outputs. This can increase the perceived value of the NFTs, as collectors may be willing to pay a premium for a truly unique and one-of-a-kind token.
